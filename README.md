# React-Task-Tracker
This personal project is a task tracker that allows you to 
create, delete, save, and load tasks
this web app also utilizes a Json API which saves your tasks whenever you close out of the web app.
This project is a step up from my python to do list because I wanted to build something more complex and incorporate a better UI.
